# Project 1: Smart Shopping Cart Interface
## Sophia Keller

### Project Description
For this project, I designed and implemented an interactive user interface for a smart shopping cart.
This interface gives the user access to different features that aim to reduce the stress of grocery
shopping and provide a more pleasant shopping experience overall. Since I cannot actually create a
smart shopping cart, I have simulated the user interface (that would be on a tablet-like device on
the shopping cart) using a web-based interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have documented my
design process and implementation [here](https://sophiakeller-portfolio.weebly.com/project-1.html).
